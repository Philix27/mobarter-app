Contributions I have madeThis project is still in development phase. I have successfully signed up with multiple third party companies which covers utility bill payments such as airtime, data, tv subscriptions and many more for Nigerian market. Mobarter serves as a middleman between this provider and the crypto world which would enable users to make these payments using the cUSD token. Contributions to Celo EcosystemThrough this project the Celo Ecosystem will experience an increase in volume of transactions because Minipay reduces the friction to onboard new users to web3 as most of the complexities associated with blockchain has been abstracted. Current ProgressHow this Pool will support these efforts?





Mobarter aims to provide a platform where users can make thier day to day transactions on the blockchain using cUSD. 

Reduce the barrier associated with onboarding new users to web3
